The **Map** object holds key-value pairs and _remembers the original insertion order of the keys_. Any value (both objects and primitive values) may be used as either a key or a value.

A `Map` object iterates its elements in insertion order - a `for...of` loop returns an aray of `[key, value]` for each iteration.

## Objects vs. Maps

`Object` is similar to `Map`â€”both let you set keys to
values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is
stored at a key. For this reason (and because there were no built-in
alternatives), `Object` has been used as `Map` historically.

However, there are important differences that make `Map` preferable in some
cases:

        <p>
          An <code>Object</code> has a prototype, so it contains default keys
          that could collide with your own keys if you're not careful.

      <td>
        <p>
          The keys in <code>Map</code> are ordered in a simple, straightforward
          way: A <code>Map</code> object iterates entries, keys, and values in
          the order of entry insertion.
        </p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>
          Although the keys of an ordinary <code>Object</code> are ordered now,
          this was not always the case, and the order is complex. As a result,
          it's best not to rely on property order.
        </p>
        <p>
          The order was first defined for own properties only in ECMAScript
          2015; ECMAScript 2020 defines order for inherited properties as well.

          abstract specification operations. But note that no single mechanism

          <strong>all</strong> of an object's properties; the various mechanisms
          each include different subsets of properties.

          "for-in")}}

          string-keyed properties even if non-enumerable;
